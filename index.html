                <p>Hey stalker, It's nice to meet you. So I am 22 year old rookie who has dreams to be a refined web|software developer. My name is Vikram Vishwakarma & I live somewhere in India, In a city called Nashik, Maharashtra. I am a Third year CS student who wants to be a Software/App/Web Developer & Graphic/UI/UX Designer. Yes I know its a lot. But life becomes boring if there are no challenges to face on, that's why its important for me to ride on this rollercoaster. It will be either lots of fun or a nightmare, doesn't matter.</p>

                <h3>Experiences <br> of a cs student life !)</h3>
                <p>In the starting, I was like the other people who had the same interest in cs course, i started to learn from everywhere i could've. Later when it felt like there is no use & results from doing it in a unordered way. Then i asked some people who were already in that field and started to learn things which were necessary and important for me. Like the Types of Programming Languages, Building Logic, Used Applications, Making visuals by using web development languages, doing projects to refine my skills and so on.</p>
